# Twenty-One is a card game consisting of a dealer and a player, where the participants try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

# Here is an overview of the game:
# - Both participants are initially dealt 2 cards from a 52-card deck.
# - The player takes the first turn, and can "hit" or "stay".
# - If the player busts, he loses. If he stays, it's the dealer's turn.
# - The dealer must hit until his cards add up to at least 17.
# - If he busts, the player wins. If both player and dealer stays, then the highest total wins.
# - If both totals are equal, then it's a tie, and nobody wins.
