# You need to modify the code so that this works:

mike = Person.new("Mike")
mike.walk
# => "Mike strolls forward"

kitty = Cat.new("Kitty")
kitty.walk
# => "Kitty saunters forward"

flash = Cheetah.new("Flash")
flash.walk
# => "Flash runs forward"
# You are only allowed to write one new method to do this
