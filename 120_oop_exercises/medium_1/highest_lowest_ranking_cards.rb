# Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:


class Card
  # Enumerable#min and Enumerale#max work with objects whose classes mix-in the Comparable module. The class must provide a #<=> method
  include Comparable
  ORDER = (2..10).to_a + ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']

  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end

  def to_s
    "#{rank} of #{suit}"
  end

  def value
    ORDER.index(rank)
  end

  def <=>(other_card) # compares them using Integer#<=>
    self.value <=> other_card.value
  end
end
# For this exercise, numeric cards are low cards, ordered from 2 through 10. Jacks are higher than 10s, Queens are higher than Jacks, Kings are higher than Queens, and Aces are higher than Kings. The suit plays no part in the relative ranking of cards.

# If you have two or more cards of the same rank in your list, your min and max methods should return one of the matching cards; it doesn't matter which one.

# Besides any methods needed to determine the lowest and highest cards, create a #to_s method that returns a String representation of the card, e.g., "Jack of Diamonds", "4 of Clubs", etc.

# Examples:

cards = [Card.new(2, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(10, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')]
p cards
puts cards # 2 of Hearts, 10 of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs
p cards.min #== Card.new(2, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new('Ace', 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(5, 'Hearts')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')
puts cards.max == Card.new(5, 'Hearts')

cards = [Card.new(4, 'Hearts'),
         Card.new(4, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(10, 'Clubs')]
puts cards.min.rank == 4
puts cards.max == Card.new(10, 'Clubs')

cards = [Card.new(7, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new('Jack', 'Spades')]
puts cards.min == Card.new(7, 'Diamonds')
puts cards.max.rank == 'Jack'

cards = [Card.new(8, 'Diamonds'),
         Card.new(8, 'Clubs'),
         Card.new(8, 'Spades')]
puts cards.min.rank == 8
puts cards.max.rank == 8
